# Africa's Talking PHP SDK

[![Latest Stable Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/africastalking/africastalking)](https://packagist.org/packages/africastalking/africastalking)

> This SDK provides convenient access to the Africa's Talking API for applications written in PHP.

## Documentation
Take a look at the [API docs here](http://docs.africastalking.com).

## Install 

You can install the PHP SDK via composer or by downloading the source

#### Via Composer

The recommended way to install the SDK is with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). 

```bash
composer require africastalking/africastalking
```

## Usage

The SDK needs to be instantiated using your username and API key, which you can get from the [dashboard](https://account/africastalking.com).

> You can use this SDK for either production or sandbox apps. For sandbox, the app username is **ALWAYS** `sandbox`

```php
use AfricasTalking\SDK\AfricasTalking;

$username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'; // use 'sandbox' for development in the test environment
$apiKey   = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // use your sandbox app API key for development in the test environment
$AT       = new AfricasTalking($username, $apiKey);

// Get one of the services
$sms      = $AT->sms();

// Use the service
$result   = $sms->send([
    'to'      => '+2XXYYYOOO',
    'message' => 'Hello World!'
]);

print_r($result);
```

See [example](example/) for more usage examples.

## Testing the SDK

The SDK uses [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/index.html) as the test runner.

To run available tests, from the root of the project run:

```bash
# Configure needed fixtures, e.g sandbox api key, Africa's Talking products
cp tests/Fixtures.php.tpl tests/Fixtures.php

# Run tests
phpunit
```
